# NasaRoboticRovers

This project is intended to trigger the movement of rover robots landed by NASA on a plateau on mars. 
Based on the user input the rover moves across the plateau. 
For an input that triggers a specific rover out of the designaed plateau area 
a warning message is provided. 
To avoid any crash a rover is also not allowed to move in the direction which is already occupied by another rover. 

Requirement to Run the testcases: 
Junit 4, Junit 5, TestNG
